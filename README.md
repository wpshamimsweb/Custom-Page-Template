Custom Page Template for https://farkas-bata.hu/

This project involved creating a fully custom page template for a one-page website. The client initially chose a theme, but it was later converted to a custom page template from scratch using the child theme. I worked on this project from start to finish, ensuring a fully custom template integrated with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and CMB2 for repeater functionality.

Project Details:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Dynamic Template: PHP
- Interactivity: jQuery
- Design: Converted from PSD to a Custom Page Template

The repository includes the complete custom page template with all the necessary files and code.
